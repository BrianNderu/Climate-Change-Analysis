# Climate Change Analysis

## Project Overview
Climate Change has been an important issue worldwide . WIth the rise of destructive floods and extreme heat temperatures, it is essential to conduct and analysis to understand the trends in Temperarure rise. 

This project seeks to conduct a visual analysis of Surface temperature trends worldwide. This Project utilizes Data from 1966 - 2022 of recorded Surface Temperature for countries

## Tools Used
Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

## Findings(Visualizations)

### Annual Surface Temperature

From the visual, there is a steady growth of Annual Surface temperature over the years

The continous use of Fossil Fuel have an impact as they release u=huge amounts of CO2. Additionally continous deforestation, increased intensity of industrial activity, active urbanization and increased agricultural production, etc. have played a role in the annual temperature increase.

### Temperature Change Per Continent

Europe is warming the fastest, followed by Asian countries, Africa & America, and the continent that is warming the slowest is Oceania. 

### Countries with Highest Temperature Growth
<img src="/Images/output2.png"/>

These Countries have recorded the highest percentage of temperature growth Worldwide indicating a need for Drastic interventions in the said 5 countries

### Trend for Kenya
